==========================================================

In this tutorial you learn how to create a simple mobile client for tweets. It 
uses the twitter-like, free identi.ca service. The client displays all tweets 
of a given user. When a tweet is selected, the details of the tweet are shown.

Requirements
------------

You should be familiar with qooxdoo the tool chain and the basic 
object-oriented principles of the framework. A working qooxdoo development 
environment is mandatory.

As qooxdoo is based on standard web technologies, you can use a regular 
Google Chrome or Apple Safari browser on your system to run the app 
(see qooxdoo mobile requirements). An iOS or Android device is not necessarily 
required.
